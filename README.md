# The Angular Application
We'll use Angular CLI, a powerful command-line utility, to create our Angular application.

Angular CLI is an extremely valuable tool since it allows us to create an entire Angular project from scratch, generating components, services, classes, and interfaces with just a few commands.

We can generate our Angular application structure from the ground up, but honestly, this is an error-prone and time-consuming task that we should avoid in all cases.

Instead, we'll let Angular CLI do the hard work for us. So we can open a command console, then navigate to the folder where we want our application to be created, and type the command:

ng new angularclient

# Deploying the server

Run 'ng serve--open' for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or type 'ng serve--open' this will automatically redirect you to the dashboard. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
